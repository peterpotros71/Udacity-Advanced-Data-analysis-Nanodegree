# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Peter Potros Nassim


## Dataset

The data consisted of duration_sec and attributes of approximately 180000 trips. 
The attributes included the five Cs of trips, as well as additional measurements such as start_station_id, start_station_latitude, 
start_station_longitude, end_station_id end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude and bike_id.



## Summary of Findings

Duration Times in the dataset take on a very large range of values, from about 60 sec at the lowest, to about 85,000 sec at the highest. 
Plotted on a logarithmic scale, the distribution of duration times takes on a normal distribution.
number of users that are subscribers are much higher than are customers, but customers take longer duration times of trip than subscribers.
number of males are highr than females, but females have long duartion median than males.

Outside of the main variables of interest, I verified the relationship between start_station_latitude and end_station_latitude, but there is no interaction between start_station_latitude or end_station_latitude and duration of trips



## Key Insights for Presentation

at 7,8,9 am and 16,17,18 pm most of trips start on all the weekdays but not on sundays and stardays where the weekends. 
on the other hand at the rest of day the number of trips start equally on all days of the week which aren't connected to work hours.
number of customers are the same for all days of week, i think these users which uses bikes for practicing and exercises not for work 
beacause the avg duration times of their trips are longer than for consumers.
the trips that start at all hours of sundays and saturdays take longer duration mean than the other days of week, 
which confirms that these trips for joureny and exercises not for work.
